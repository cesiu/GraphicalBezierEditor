**GraphicalBezierEditor** was the very first larger software project I worked
on, beginning as an experiment in my first introductory computer science course,
which was taught using the Processing development environment. The editor is
both for use with Processing and written in Processing's Java-based code. It
allows users to define vector graphics in a similar manner to Photoshop's pen
tool, then copy the code defining those graphics for use in their own Processing
projects. 

######Status######
Other than a repackaging into a cross-platform JAR, GraphicalBezierEditor has
not been under active development since December of 2013.

######Usage######
I recommend running the PDE file in Processing 2 if possible rather than using
the executable JAR, which is automatically generated by Processing and rather
laggy on some systems.
